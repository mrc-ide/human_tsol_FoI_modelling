# Human Taenia solium force-of-infection modelling project
Project to fit catalytic models to human Taenia solium age-(sero)prevalence data to estimate per-capita seroconversion / infection rates (force-of infection; FoI) and seroreversion / infection loss rates.

## Table of contents

## Background
The FoI describes the average (per capita) rate at which susceptible individuals seroconvert (become Ab-positive) or become infected. Catalytic models, first proposed for fitting to epidemiological data by Muench (1934), can be fitted to age-(sero)prevalence curves to estimate the FoI. A reversible configuration of the model can also be used to estimate the (per-capita) rate at which individual serorevert (become Ab-negative) or clear infection. 

This project presents the first analysis to estimate these rates for T. solium human cysticercosis and human taeniasis, across a range of epidmeiological settings, after identifying suitable age-(sero)prevalence data from a systematic literature review. Cataltyic models are fitted using a bayesian framework, incorporating uncertainty in diagnostic performance (sensitivity and specificty of each test used) using the formula given by Diggle, (2011). Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are used to estimate posterior distributions for parameters of interest (FoI, seroreversion/infection loss and diagnostic sensitvity and specificty). Our analysis therefore assesses global variation in these important epidemiological quantities to inform development of transmission models, and to support control efforts.

We provide here the code to support this analysis.

## Code guide

The master script is split into:
1) fitting to single datasets
2) fitting to multiple datasets (this will estimate FoI/seroreversion or infection loss from each dataset, with a joint sensitivity and specifcity across datasets)

This is a complementary study to the pig cysticercosis FoI analysis conducted by this group and published in Scientific Reports:

Together, these studies can be used to parameterise both the pig and human elements of a T. solium transmission model (where FoI estimates for pig and human infection exist for similar settings).
